# oswe — White-Box Security Audit Plugin for Claude Code

Deep, OSWE-style white-box web application security audit. Run `/oswe:audit` in a trusted
workspace to detect source-to-sink vulnerabilities and chain them toward unauthenticated RCE,
with an evidence-backed report.

## Scope (MVP)
PHP (Laravel/Symfony/vanilla) and Node.js (Express/Nest). Python, Java, .NET are planned (Phase 2).

## Install (local dev)
```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/claude-oswe
```

## Usage
```
/oswe:audit            # audit the whole project
/oswe:audit src/api    # restrict to a path (must stay inside the project)
```
The audit never auto-runs (`disable-model-invocation: true`); it triggers only on the explicit
command. A dated report is written to `.oswe/reports/`.

## How it works
A skill orchestrates: recon → partition → analyze (parallel read-only `oswe-analyzer` subagents,
max 4) → aggregate/dedupe → build chains → verify (independent `oswe-verifier`, batched) → report.
Agent outputs are JSON validated against `skills/audit/schemas/` by a self-contained Node validator.

## Authorization & ethics
For **authorized** white-box review of code you own or are permitted to test, for **defensive**
purposes (find and fix). Do not audit untrusted/hostile repositories. Secrets are never written to
the report (`[REDACTED]`). "No path to RCE" means "none found within the analyzed coverage", not
proof of absence.

## Development
Regenerate the validators after changing any schema:
```bash
( cd skills/audit/scripts && npm install && npm run build && npm test )
```
