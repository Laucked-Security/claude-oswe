# OSWE Plugin — HTML Report Export Design

**Status:** approved-design (pending written-spec review)
**Date:** 2026-06-16
**Depends on:** merged MVP + Phase 2 (the `oswe` plugin on `master`).
**Branch (implementation):** `feat/oswe-html-report` (off `master`).

## 1. Goal

Every `/oswe:audit` run already writes a redaction-safe Markdown report to
`.oswe/reports/oswe-report-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md`. This feature adds, **alongside** it and with the
**same basename**, a self-contained visual HTML report
`.oswe/reports/oswe-report-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.html` containing the report body plus four SVG charts.
The user can `Ctrl+P → “Save as PDF”` in a browser to obtain a PDF — so we satisfy the “PDF” need
without a true binary-PDF generator.

The Markdown remains the **canonical, single redacted source of truth**; the HTML is its visual
rendering. Zero regression: the existing `.md` and all current E2E tooling (which compares `.md`
against `EXPECTED.md`) are untouched.

## 2. Hard constraints (inherited from the project)

- **Zero runtime dependency.** Like `validators.mjs`, the renderer runs with **no `node_modules`**:
  no charting library, no Markdown library, no headless browser. Charts are hand-built inline SVG;
  Markdown→HTML is a small purpose-built converter.
- **Self-contained output.** One `.html` file: all CSS in a `<style>` block, all charts inline
  `<svg>`, **no `<script>`**, no external fonts/images/stylesheets, no network access. A restrictive
  CSP `<meta>` (§6) reinforces this.
- **Node ≥ 20**, ESM, same `--file`/`--out` CLI discipline and exit-code contract as the other five
  helpers (`0` ok / `1` invalid input / `2` IO|usage).
- **Security tool posture.** The audited repo is **untrusted data**; the renderer must never let
  repo-derived text become live HTML/SVG markup (see §6).

## 3. Components

### 3.1 New helper: `skills/audit/scripts/render-html.mjs`

```
node render-html.mjs --md <report.md> --summary <summary.json> --out <report.html>
```

- Reads the redaction-safe `.md` and the non-sensitive `summary.json`.
- **Validates the summary** (kind `report-summary`, via the generated `./validators.mjs`) before
  rendering. An invalid summary is an **orchestrator-input bug** → exit 1, **no HTML written**.
- Renders a single self-contained HTML document:
  - **Body** = Markdown→HTML conversion of the `.md` (the converter scope is fixed; see §4).
  - **Charts** = four inline SVGs computed from the summary (see §5).
- **Atomic write (adjustment 1).** Writes to `${out}.tmp-<pid>` then `fs.renameSync` to `${out}`.
  A crash mid-render never leaves a partial `report.html`; the `.tmp-<pid>` file is removed on any
  error path and is never renamed.
- Exit codes: `0` success; `1` invalid `--summary` (schema-invalid → no output); `2` IO/usage
  (missing/unreadable `--md` or `--summary`, missing flags, unwritable `--out` target dir).

### 3.2 New schema: `skills/audit/schemas/report-summary.schema.json`

JSON Schema draft 2020-12 describing the summary object (§7). It is compiled into the standalone
validator the same way as the existing six:

- **Adjustment 3 — explicit export.** Add to `build-validators.mjs`’s `EXPORT_NAME` map:
  `"report-summary.schema.json": "reportSummary"`, then regenerate `validators.mjs`
  (`node build-validators.mjs`). `render-html.mjs` imports `{ reportSummary }` from `./validators.mjs`
  (which remains zero-dependency). The committed `validators.mjs` now exports seven validators.

### 3.3 Pipeline integration: `skills/audit/SKILL.md` phase 7

Phase 7 becomes (additive; step 1 is exactly today’s behaviour):

1. Write the `.md` report (**unchanged**).
2. Build the `summary` object from the **final findings/chains/gaps plus the orchestrator’s
   aggregated coverage** (adjustment 2 — `analyzed`/`skipped` come from the orchestrator’s
   analyzer-coverage state and `gaps[]`, not from the settled `apply-verdicts` result alone).
   Write it to a literal `.oswe/tmp/` path under a `trap … rm` like every other helper input.
3. Run `render-html.mjs --md … --summary … --out <same-basename>.html`.
4. Purge `.oswe/tmp/` (as today).

**Resilience — the HTML can never fail the audit (§ from review).** If `render-html.mjs` exits
non-zero, the orchestrator logs in the chat summary
(`HTML export failed: <reason>; Markdown report at <path>`) and continues normally (temp still
purged). The `.md` is the guaranteed artifact; the `.html` is a convenience.

## 4. Markdown→HTML converter scope (fixed, minimal)

The converter interprets **only** the constructs the OSWE report format uses; everything else is
emitted as escaped literal text. Supported:

- ATX headings `#`, `##`, `###`
- GFM pipe tables (header row + `|---|` separator + body rows)
- `**bold**`
- `*italic*` (used inside blockquotes, e.g. `*"Intentionally vulnerable … DO NOT DEPLOY"*`) → `<em>`.
  The converter resolves `**bold**` (and `__bold__`) **before** single-`*`/`_` italic so the longer
  delimiter is not mis-split.
- `` `inline code` ``
- blockquote `> `
- unordered lists `- `
- strikethrough `~~text~~` (used for refuted/`réfutée` findings)
- horizontal rule `---`

Explicitly **not** interpreted (rendered as escaped text): raw HTML, images, Markdown links,
reference links, footnotes, nested/ordered lists, code fences with language execution, autolinks.
(If the report later needs one of these, it’s a deliberate scope extension with its own test.)

## 5. Charts (inline SVG, deterministic, computed from the summary)

All four are pure functions of the summary; no randomness, no time, no layout engine.

1. **Severity donut.** Segments for Critique/Haute/Moyenne/Basse/Info with fixed colors + a legend
   showing each count. **Adjustment 4 — empty state:** when the total of all severity counts is `0`
   (the typical *safe* fixture), render a single grey ring (no segment maths, **no division by
   zero**) with a “No findings” label and a zeroed legend.
2. **Exploit-chain diagram.** Per chain: boxes `entry → OSWE-1 → … → RCE` connected by arrows
   labeled with each transition verdict (`accepted`/`downgraded`/`rejected`). `entry` is marked
   *unauthenticated* when `entry_auth === "unauthenticated"`; the terminal `RCE` node is red when the
   chain severity is Critique. When there are zero chains, the section renders a short
   “No exploit chains” note instead of an empty SVG.
3. **Coverage bar.** A horizontal bar split analyzed vs skipped from `summary.coverage`.
4. **Finding-status bar.** A stacked bar of accepted / downgraded / rejected / not-requested from
   `summary.finding_status_counts`.

## 6. Security

- **Universal escaping before formatting.** Every piece of text taken from the `.md` is HTML-escaped
  (`&`, `<`, `>`, `"`) **before** any formatting transformation is applied, and formatting is then
  applied only via controlled, whitelisted substitutions on the already-escaped text. The converter
  passes **no raw HTML** through. A finding title containing `<img onerror=…>` must render as
  `&lt;img onerror=…&gt;`, never execute.
- **Adjustment 7 — SVG text is escaped too.** Every dynamic label injected into an SVG `<text>` node,
  and every dynamic `meta` field placed into the HTML (target, stack, date, proof level), is escaped
  with the same function. SVG is active content, so node labels (`entry`, `OSWE-N`, `RCE` — the
  closed set of §7.2) and `meta.*` get the identical treatment — defense in depth even though the
  node labels are already a strictly-patterned closed set.
- **Single redaction point.** The `.md` is the only redacted source; the HTML body inherits its
  `[REDACTED]` safety. The summary carries **only non-sensitive aggregates** (counts, enum labels,
  `OSWE-N` ids) — no secrets, no code excerpts, no `file:line`. The `.html` is written to the
  persistent, safe `.oswe/reports/`; the transient `summary.json` lives in `.oswe/tmp/` under a
  `trap … rm` and is purged at phase-7 end (and on any abort), exactly like the other helper inputs.
- **Content-Security-Policy meta (adjustment 4).** The generated document includes
  `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'none'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'; base-uri 'none'; form-action 'none'">`.
  Escaping is the real defense, but for a security tool this is coherent hardening: `default-src
  'none'` blocks any external/script/image/frame load, `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` permits only the
  inline `<style>` (our CSS), and `base-uri`/`form-action 'none'` neutralize base-tag and form
  tricks. Inline SVG is part of the document (not a resource load) so it is unaffected.
- **Print CSS.** An `@media print` block makes `Ctrl+P → Save as PDF` clean (page breaks before each
  chain/finding section, dark-on-white). No interactivity is required for printing.

## 7. The `summary` JSON (non-sensitive aggregates only)

Built by the orchestrator in phase 7 from the final findings/chains/gaps + aggregated coverage.
Shape (validated by `report-summary.schema.json`):

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "target": "test-fixtures/python/vulnerable",
    "stack": "Python / Flask 3.0.3",
    "date": "2026-06-16 10:15",
    "verdict": "unauth-rce",
    "proof_level": "preuve statique forte"
  },
  "severity_counts": { "Critique": 1, "Haute": 2, "Moyenne": 0, "Basse": 0, "Info": 0 },
  "finding_status_counts": { "accepted": 2, "downgraded": 0, "rejected": 0, "not-requested": 0 },
  "coverage": { "analyzed": 2, "skipped": 0 },
  "chains": [
    {
      "id": "CHAIN-1",
      "severity": "Critique",
      "entry_auth": "unauthenticated",
      "final_impact": "unauth-rce",
      "nodes": ["entry", "OSWE-1", "OSWE-2", "RCE"],
      "edges": [
        { "from": "entry",  "to": "OSWE-1", "verdict": "accepted" },
        { "from": "OSWE-1", "to": "OSWE-2", "verdict": "accepted" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 7.1 Field semantics (what each count means)

To avoid the orchestrator counting chains and findings inconsistently, each field is defined
explicitly and must mirror how the Markdown report presents the same numbers:

- **`severity_counts.Critique` = the number of `accepted` Critique exploit chains.** Critique is
  reserved for chains (the `finding` schema forbids a `Critique` final severity), so this field
  counts chains, never findings.
- **`severity_counts.{Haute,Moyenne,Basse,Info}` = the number of findings whose _reported_ severity
  equals that level**, using the **same selection the Markdown uses**: `final_severity` for
  `accepted`/`downgraded` findings, `provisional_severity` for `not-requested` findings, and
  **`rejected` findings are excluded** (they have no live severity — they appear only struck-through /
  in the annex). A finding is counted in exactly one of these four buckets.
- **`finding_status_counts.{accepted,downgraded,rejected,not-requested}` = the number of findings in
  each `verification_status`.** Their sum = total findings (including rejected); this is independent
  of `severity_counts`, which excludes rejected.
- **`coverage.analyzed` / `coverage.skipped`** = analyzed partitions vs coverage gaps, from the
  orchestrator’s aggregated analyzer-coverage state plus `gaps[]` (see §3.3, adjustment 2).

### 7.2 Schema rules (strict — keeps the summary non-sensitive)

- `meta.verdict` ∈ {`unauth-rce`, `no-critique`}; `meta.proof_level` is a string or `null`;
  `meta.target`/`stack`/`date` are bounded strings (rendered escaped — they may contain repo-derived
  text, so they are treated as untrusted, but they carry no secrets/`file:line`).
- `severity_counts` has **exactly** the five severity keys, each an integer ≥ 0;
  `finding_status_counts` has **exactly** the four status keys, each an integer ≥ 0;
  `coverage.analyzed`/`skipped` integers ≥ 0.
- `chains` is an array (possibly empty). Per chain: `id` matches **`^CHAIN-[0-9]+$`**; `severity` ∈
  the five severities; `entry_auth` ∈ {`unauthenticated`,`authenticated`,`admin`};
  `final_impact` a bounded string.
- **Graph labels are strictly patterned — no free text (adjustment 3).** Every `nodes[]` entry and
  every `edges[].from`/`edges[].to` matches **exactly one of**: the literal `entry`, the literal
  `RCE`, or **`^OSWE-[0-9]+$`**. `edges[].verdict` ∈ {`accepted`,`downgraded`,`rejected`}. (Node
  labels deliberately do **not** include `vuln_class` or any title — the body MD already carries the
  human-readable class/title; keeping nodes to this closed set guarantees the summary cannot leak
  repo text through the diagram.)
- `additionalProperties:false` throughout, so any orchestrator mistake is caught as exit 1.

## 8. Testing (`skills/audit/scripts/test/render-html.test.mjs`, added to `node --test`)

- **MD→HTML constructs:** each supported construct (headings, table, bold, italic, inline code,
  blockquote, list, hr, strikethrough) renders to the expected tag(s). Includes a `**bold**` /
  `*italic*` precedence case (`**a** and *b*` → `<strong>a</strong> and <em>b</em>`, not mis-split).
- **Security / escaping:** a `.md` whose heading, a table cell, and an inline-code span each contain
  `<script>alert(1)</script>` and `"><img onerror=x>` renders them as entities — **no live tags**.
- **SVG label escaping (adjustment 7):** a summary/meta with `<`/`>`/`"`/`&` in `target`/`stack`
  (and a node label) yields escaped `<text>`/header content — no raw markup injected into SVG.
- **Charts from summary:** a given summary yields SVG carrying the right counts/segments; the chain
  diagram’s node/edge counts equal the summary’s; coverage/status bars reflect their counts.
- **Empty states (adjustment 4):** all-zero `severity_counts` → grey empty-ring donut, **no NaN /
  no division by zero**; zero `chains` → “No exploit chains” note.
- **Self-contained (adjustment 5):** the generated document contains **no active/external markup
  emitted by the renderer** — no real `<script`, `<img`, `<iframe`, `<object`, `<embed`, `<link`
  tags and no `href=`/`src=` attributes in generated tags. Escaped occurrences inside text
  (`&lt;img src=…&gt;`) are **accepted**. The only tags the renderer emits are the document chrome
  plus the SVG whitelist (`<svg> <g> <rect> <circle> <path> <text> <line> <polygon>` etc.).
- **CSP meta present (adjustment 4):** the document contains the exact
  `Content-Security-Policy` meta with `default-src 'none'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'; base-uri 'none';
  form-action 'none'`.
- **CLI behaviour (adjustment 6):**
  - invalid `--summary` (schema-invalid) → **exit 1** and **no final `report.html`** (atomic write +
    early validation guarantee this);
  - missing `--md`/`--summary` flag, nonexistent `--md`/`--summary` file, or unwritable `--out`
    directory → **exit 2**;
  - on every error path, any `.tmp-<pid>` scratch file is removed (no leftover partial output).
- **Determinism:** same `--md` + `--summary` → **byte-identical** `.html`.

The existing MVP regression (currently 88 tests) must still pass; this only adds tests.

## 9. Docs

- `README.md`: note that each audit also produces a self-contained visual HTML report next to the
  Markdown, printable to PDF from a browser.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: description may mention “Markdown + HTML reports” (optional, minor).
- `skills/audit/SKILL.md`: extend the “Report” / “Report format” section with an **HTML export**
  subsection describing phase-7 step 2–4 and the never-gates-the-audit rule.

## 10. Out of scope (YAGNI)

- No true binary PDF generator (no vendored PDF lib, no headless browser).
- No configurable themes, no JS interactivity, no multi-report dashboard/aggregation.
- No changes to the `finding`/`chain`/`verdict`/`analyzer-response`/`verifier-response` schemas or to
  `aggregate-findings`/`apply-verdicts`/`confine-path`/`validate-*` helpers.
- No new Markdown features beyond §4’s fixed set.

## 11. Acceptance criteria

- `render-html.mjs` exists, zero runtime deps, atomic write, exit-code contract per §3.1.
- `report-summary.schema.json` added; `build-validators.mjs` exports `reportSummary`; `validators.mjs`
  regenerated (7 validators) and still loads with no `node_modules`.
- SKILL phase 7 emits the `.html` alongside the `.md`; HTML failure never aborts the audit.
- All §8 tests pass; MVP regression still green; `claude plugin validate . --strict` passes.
- Manual check: open a vulnerable-fixture `.html` (donut + chain diagram + bars render; Ctrl+P → PDF
  looks clean) and a safe-fixture `.html` (empty-state donut, “No exploit chains”).
- README/manifest/SKILL updated.
